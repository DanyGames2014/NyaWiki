In this tutorial you will learn how to add a recipe to the game, you can do that in two ways, either the [Data Driven](Data%20Driven%20Recipes.md) way where you add them using a json file or the [Code Driven](Code%20Driven%20Recipes.md) way where you define them programmaticaly. I personally recommend using the data driven approach when possible and only using the code driven way when required.  

You can learn more about both ways on their respective pages:  
[Data Driven Recipes](Data%20Driven%20Recipes.md)  
[Code Driven Recipes](Code%20Driven%20Recipes.md)
