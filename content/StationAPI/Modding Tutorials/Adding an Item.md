In this tutorial you will learn how to add an item to the game, as well as texture and localization for it. StationAPI provides templates for pretty much any item type present in the vanilla game, such as food, tools etc.  
When creating items, some of these templates might actually be sufficient, other time you might wanna alter the behaviour of the item in which we will extend the Template and add our required changes, we will go over both ways as after the item is initialized the procedure is the same.
