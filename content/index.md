Welcome to NyaWiki! This is Not Your Average Wiki, here we talk in the first person, and that's probably the only difference.   
Realistically this is just a bad attempt at pretending the name is an acronym, because it isn't, it's the sound that catgirls and sometimes I make and I enjoy how people have to constantly point it out :d I don't even know why you are reading this, you probably came here because you wanted to learn how to [add an item](Adding%20an%20Item.md) or what the hell do all those [files in the project folder](Project%20Structure.md) do, so just look slightly to the left and browse around for the stuff you really came here for :p
