### Transferring force ###
Axles and gear boxes are needed to transfer rotational force. Gear boxes have an input side marked with arrows and a hole, all other sides are outputs. Gear boxes can be turned off with redstone which means that no force comes out of its outputs. Axles can be connected up to a length of 3, the 4th axle breaks when powered. Machines that require rotational force usually have clearly marked input sides as well.

### Generating force ###
Rotational force can be generated using either a wind mill or a water wheel. The generator needs to be placed on an axle. Only 1 generator is needed per network. The wind mill needs a lot of space as a special requirement while the water wheel is smaller but requires a stream of water below. Wind mills can break during thunder if the gear box they are attached to is not turned off. A hand crank can be used to manually generate force but it only works for the mill stone. Hand cranks break when they power more than 1 mill stone.
