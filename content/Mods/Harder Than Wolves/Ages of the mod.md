## Implemented ages ##
### Wood age ###
Gather wood from trees and start crafting wood tools. Mine and smelt stone for crafting the mill stone, hand crank, and stone tools. The goal of this age is to farm enough hemp and mill it into fibers to craft stone tools alongside the stone chisel.

### Stone age ###
Mine stone blocks with the stone chisel to obtain stone bricks. Build a metal forge out of stone bricks. Craft a stone pickaxe to mine iron ore. Mill the iron ore into iron ore gravel using the mill stone. Find coal to mill it into coal dust for a fire pile. Smelt iron ore into iron ingots.

### Iron age ###
The goal is to build a saw to create moulding for iron tools. This age contains a big chunk of the Better Than Wolves progression. The main challenges of this age consist of getting enough hemp to craft a wind mill and to find a wolf. Find a wolf and tame it into a dog. Bring the dog back to the base to obtain dung. Craft a cauldron from iron ingots to create tanned leather for a saw. Build the wind mill to power the saw. Once all steps have been, it is possible to craft iron tools and finish the iron age.

## Planned ages ##
### Gold age ###
Craft a rotary sieve and fill it with gold ore gravel. Place the filled sieve on a turntable to create a centrifuge which ejects gold ore chunks. Craft the gold ore chunks into gold ore blocks and smelt them in the metal forge. Craft gold tools to get special drops. See more about gold tools in [New game mechanics](New%20game%20mechanics.md). Process mystical hemp into mystical fibers. Put mystical pebble into a rotary sieve to get mystical rocks. Craft a spawner harness from mystical cobblestone, monster cloth, and gold. Find a monster spawner and place the spawner harness below. Charge mystical rocks with the spawner harness as a power source for the soul infuser. Build a soul infuser using previously obtained resources. Mine diamonds with an iron pickaxe and infuse them in the soul infuser with lapis and iron to get raw diamond ingots. Throw the raw ingots alongside gun powder into a cauldron to obtain diamond ingots to finish the gold age.

### Diamond age ###
Craft a diamond pickaxe and mine obsidian with it. Create diamond gears for higher tier machines. Craft a diamond saw from diamond gears to saw obsidian into plates. Craft a diamond mill stone to unlock new milling recipes. Process the obsidian into smooth obsidian using the diamond mill stone and infuse it into chiselsed obsidian with obsidian plates for a Nether portal frame. Place the chiseled obsidian blocks into the corners and light the Nether portal. This marks the beginning of the Nether age.

### Nether Age ###
This is where Harder Than Wolves itself concludes and the rest of the progression continues with the end goal of Better Than Wolves which is to craft steel. Most notable changes are infusion recipes for some blocks and items.
