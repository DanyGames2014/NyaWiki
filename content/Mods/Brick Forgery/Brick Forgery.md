Brick Forgery is a work in progress tech and exploration mod. It has a major focus on creating unusual machines from bricks. The main goal is to rediscover the remnants of past civilizations and use the leftovers to build truly unique brick devices and building blocks. It builds up on the progression of [Better Than Wolves](Better%20Than%20Wolves.md) and [Harder Than Wolves](Harder%20Than%20Wolves.md).

**The mod is still heavily work in progress. The wiki will be expanded once the mod releases.**
